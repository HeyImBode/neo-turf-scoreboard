neo-turf-scoreboard
===================

How to:

- Add the scoreboard.html in the scoreboard folder to your OBS as a browser source
	- Width is somewhat variable, can make it wider and it will float names to the edge of the specified size
	- I used Width at 575 and Height at 600 in the browser source
	
- Use StreamControl.exe to control it

- That's it
